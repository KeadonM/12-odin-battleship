# Battleship

This is a classic Battleship game developed to practice TypeScript, TDD, and maintaining developing applications with minimal coupling. The game is played against the computer, the computer player makes random moves until it finds a ship. It then targets adjacent squares until the ship is sunk. The game allows the human player to drag and drop their ships onto the board using the html drag and drop api.

It was an [assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-battleship) from The Odin Project curriculum.

**Note:** ship placement currently only works on desktop due to html drag and drop api limitations.
